# Contributing

You are considering a contribution to *boxes*? That's fantastic!

All *boxes* development has moved to the GitHub social coding platform:

  - [Development Wiki](https://github.com/{{ site.github }}/wiki)
  - [Sources](https://github.com/{{ site.github }})
  - [Bug Reports and Feature Requests](https://github.com/{{ site.github }}/issues)
  - [Change Log](https://github.com/{{ site.github }}/commits/master)
  - [History of Releases](https://github.com/{{ site.github }}/wiki/Release-History)

Boxes has been around a long time. It is available for many platforms (in reality for many more than those featured on the [download page]({{ site.baseurl }}/download.html)). Great care has been taken to make the *boxes* source as compatible as possible with all kinds of different platforms.

The planned functionality has long been implemented, and it is very stable. Development has thus slowed down and concentrates on maintenance and contributor-supplied changes.

Changes must be introduced by creating pull requests on GitHub. Note that you can improve the *boxes* code as well as the website content! Ideas for new box designs should be submitted via GitHub, but since the most beautiful designs sometimes come from non-technical people, I also accept emails for those.

The author can be contacted via email anytime, but please do not be offended when the response is slow. Even if it takes weeks or months, your email is never lost!
