# Legal Terms

*Boxes* is free software under the terms of the <A TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html#TOC1">GNU General Public License, version&nbsp;2</A> (GNU GPL), a copy of which you should have received with your source archive (filename of *COPYING* or *LICENSE*).

Among many other things, the GNU GPL states that there is **no warranty** whatsoever. If *boxes* filters away your master's thesis that's your problem! You are using the program entirely at your own risk. On the other hand, it is free. Here is an excerpt from the GNU GPL:


> **11.** Because the program is licensed free of charge, there is no warranty for the program, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and/or other parties provide the program "as is" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you. Should the program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.
> **12.** In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who may modify and/or redistribute the program as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the program (including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the program to operate with any other programs), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
