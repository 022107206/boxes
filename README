GETTING IT

    http://home.pages.de/~jensen/boxes/

    Boxes is free software under the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL).
    See COPYING file or http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html.


COMPILING IT

    1. Unpack the archive

    2. Edit the top level Makefile and change the value of GLOBALCONF to
       whereever you want the system-wide config file to reside. Note that
       each user may have his/her own config file in $HOME/.boxes.

    3. Type 'make' in the top level directory.
       This should leave you with a binary in the src directory.

       The author takes care that this always works under intel/Linux and
       sparc/Solaris, the latter of which is the boxes development
       platform.
       If you are on a different platform and somehow manage to materialize
       a binary, please send it to the author (thomas@home-of.tj), so it
       can be posted on the boxes home page. Boxes is generally very easy
       to port, because it uses only a small set of instructions and is
       based on ANSI C.


INSTALLING IT

    1. Copy doc/boxes.1 to an appropriate manual page directory (such as
       /usr/local/man/man1).
       Copy boxes-config to the location specified in the Makefile as being
       the name of the system-wide boxes config file.
       Copy src/boxes (the binary) to a location which is in your path
       (such as /usr/local/bin).

       Example:
            cp doc/boxes.1 /usr/local/man/man1
            cp boxes-config /usr/local/share/boxes
            cp src/boxes /usr/local/bin

    2. If you want to make your own changes to the config file, copy the
       system-wide config file into your home as $HOME/.boxes, then modify
       it. Boxes will use $HOME/.boxes is it exists.


RUNNING IT

    Try if boxes works by typing "boxes" on the command line, then enter
    "foo", press return and hit Ctrl-D. It should give you something
    like that:  /*******/
                /* foo */
                /*******/

    Detailed usage information is is the manual page and a lot more can be
    found on the Web page (see above). It is especially interesting to tie
    boxes to your editor, so it is invoked on a simple keypress.
