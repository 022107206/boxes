GETTING IT

    http://home.pages.de/~jensen/boxes/

    Boxes is free software under the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL).
    See COPYING file or http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html.


COMPILING IT

    Skip this section if you got yourself a binary distribution. NOTE,
    however, that the location of the system-wide config file can only be
    changed using the source distribution, because its path is compiled in.

    1. Unpack the archive

    2. Edit the top level Makefile and change the value of GLOBALCONF to
       whereever you want the system-wide config file to reside. Note that
       each user may have his/her own config file in $HOME/.boxes.

    3. Type 'make' in the top level directory.
       This should leave you with a binary in the src directory.

       The author takes care that this always works under intel/Linux and
       sparc/Solaris, the latter of which is the boxes development
       platform.
       If you are on a different platform and somehow manage to materialize
       a binary, please send it to the author (boxes@home-of.tj), so it
       can be posted on the boxes home page. Boxes is generally very easy
       to port, because it uses only a small set of instructions and is
       based on ANSI C.


INSTALLING IT

    1. Copy doc/boxes.1 to an appropriate manual page directory (such as
       /usr/local/man/man1).
       Copy boxes-config to the location specified in the Makefile as being
       the name of the system-wide boxes config file.
       Copy src/boxes (the binary) to a location which is in your path
       (such as /usr/local/bin).

       Example:
            cp doc/boxes.1 /usr/local/man/man1
            cp boxes-config /usr/local/share/boxes
            cp src/boxes /usr/local/bin

    2. If you want to make your own changes to the config file, copy the
       system-wide config file into your home as $HOME/.boxes, then modify
       it. Boxes will use $HOME/.boxes if it exists.


RUNNING IT

    Try if boxes works by typing "boxes" on the command line, then enter
    "foo", press return and hit Ctrl-D. It should give you something
    like that:  /*******/
                /* foo */
                /*******/

    Detailed usage information is in the manual page and a lot more can be
    found on the Web page (see above). It is especially interesting to tie
    boxes to your editor, so that it can be invoked by a simple keypress.


CONTACT

    * For questions which the online documentation could not answer, requests
      for more features, praise and bug reports please feel free to email
      the author at boxes@home-of.tj. Bug reports are especially appreciated.

    * For questions particular to the binary you downloaded contact the
      supplier of the binary listed on the download page.

    * Send your cool new box designs to boxdesigns@home-of.tj! If they are
      good or useful, they may be added to the official config file.
