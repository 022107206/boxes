Many contributions to the download page have been made by various people, including FreeBSD ports, a Solaris 2.5.1 port, and Red Hat RPM packages. The [current snapshot](https://github.com/{{ site.github }}) now compiles on more platforms (even on OSF/1, when `-D_ANSI_C_SOURCE` is added to the regexp compilation stuff - someone got a binary?).
