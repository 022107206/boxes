The boxes sources moved to [GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.github }})!

This will hopefully make maintaining boxes much more efficient. Issues, feature requests, and contributions are now handled via GitHub. Also, development-related documentation will eventually be moved to GitHub. Everything else on this website stays the same for now.
