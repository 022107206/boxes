The *boxes* website moved to [GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.github }}/tree/gh-pages). The address and all URLs stay the same, except that `.shtml` extensions are now plain `.html`. Redirects are in place. The new website is based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and features a new, responsive design.
Now we have the power of GitHub available for the website, too! Just check out the `gh-pages` branch to get going.
