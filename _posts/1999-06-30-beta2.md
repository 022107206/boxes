Added Solaris binary and source archive for current **beta2 version**. Barring popular request, all features are in. Do still expect enhancements on the design autodetector, GNU configure support (porting) and POSIX support for the regular expression stuff. In other words, go ahead and use this beta, because the user side won't really be affected by the planned changes.
